                Julien Larroque aka Roqieux is a blossoming full stack web-developer. This portfolio houses some of his initial projects and developments as he continues his path of education. Outside of class he enjoys a healthy mix of playing with his dog, spending time with his family, video-gaming with his friends, and working on his project car when he feels like getting his hands dirty. 

                At this time, he is available for employment and can be reached at his <a href="mailto:larroquejl@gmail.com">e-mail</a>
