Outside of class he enjoys a healthy mix of playing with his dog, spending time with his family, video-gaming with his friends, and working on his project car when he feels like getting his hands dirty. 

                At this time, he is available for employment and can be reached at <a href="mailto:larroquejl@gmail.com"/>his e-mail</a>

                <p>
                    This refactor was the introduction into HTML syntax and semantics. Refactoring a pre-made site and acting like a junior developer who is responsible for cleaning previously developed code.
